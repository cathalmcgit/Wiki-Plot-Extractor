# Wiki-Plot-Extractor
A Python tool to retrieve film plot summaries from Wikipedia, a simplified version of a ranking and rating system to assign ratings to AI-generated plot summaries.

-This program retrieves and stores film plot summaries from Wikipedia. 
-Users are prompted to enter a film title and the program attempts to fetch the plot summary from Wikipedia. 
-If successful, the information is saved into a JSON file.

- Be aware that some film titles may not be immediately recognised due to Wikipedia pages with the same name.
- For example, it is required to type 'The Shining (film)' rather than 'The Shining' to retrieve the specific plot summary.
